# Challenge 6

## Context

Prisma is dedicated to creating an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. In order to achieve this we have a couple of tools in place. 

- Prisma Code of Conduct: [https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- A focus on inclusivity and close moderation of all channels to avoid strong language or unwelcome speech

We feel this is key to Prisma's success and want to consistently find ways to make sure our community remains a welcoming and friendly environment even as it grows.

In this challenge, you'll be playing our community moderator and write a response for each statement below, asking the person to amend (not delete) their text. Provide a friendly explanation for each as to why the person should use different language, providing links to resources or similar if appropriate. 

Your answer should contain:

- Your message to the original poster
- Where you would contact them (for example DM, threaded slack response, etc)
- Why you chose that place to contact them

## Problem: Strong language

Imagine you find this comment in a GitHub issue from a community member that you have previously talked to on the Prisma Slack:

> TypeORM and Sequelize both suck compared to Photon.js. I love how fucking easy Photon makes it to talk to a database and making sure all database queries are completely type safe!

### Message to the original poster

Hey, It's great that you love Photon so much. I love it too as it's made our life as developers so easy and bug-free. But could you please edit your comment you posted on that issue on GitHub (link here) to amend the words `suck` and `fucking` with more user friendly alternatives so that it's not derogatory to the creators/maintainers of TypeORM and Sequelize (both are great libraries btw) and also maintains a friendly environment in our online community. Thank you so much in advance!

### Contact point

I would contact this person in Slack's DM as I had contacted this person on Slack earlier.

### Why did I choose the above place

I chose Slack's DM as I feel this would be the correct place to inform the user that their language was not appropriate for the platform as it woudn't maintain a friendly conversation and also to not make the user fell picked out if I had add this message in public. So according to me a DM is the best way to convey this to the user.

## Problem: Non-inclusive language

Imagine that someone reached out in the Prisma Slack `#general` channel with a technical question and prefaced their question with a `Hi guys! ðŸ‘‹`. What would you write to them about this?

### Message

Hey everyone! It's great that you all have so much love for Prisma and you constantly keep in touch with us for any issues you're facing or any Feature Requests that you have, but just a friendly reminder that we promote more gender neutral words like `people`, `folks` or `everyone`, just like I wrote here! We want everyone to have a healthy conversation and using `guys` doesn't promote that. Thank you everyone for understanding and I hope we all have a great time helping each other here and grow our community in leaps and bounds!

### Contact point

I would add a friendly note in the `#general` channel in Slack.

### Why did I choose the above place

The reason for adding it in the `#general` channel in Slack is so that all users can see and be aware that alienating a gender is incorrect and we don't accept/promote sexism intentionally or unintentionally verbally or in writing. Our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) also affirms that.
